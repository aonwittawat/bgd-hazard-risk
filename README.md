# Bangladesh Hazard & Risk Map

This is a web app of Department of Disaster Management (DDM) developed with technical support from United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) through the NORAD funded project *Strengthening Capacities in the use of Geospatial Information for Improved Resilience in Asia-Pacific and Africa* to explore the hazard & risk maps of Bangladesh. The hazard data used here are from the *Multi-Hazard Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, Modelling & Mapping Project* of DDM.

This semi-automated web application has the capability to analyze risk associated with various natural hazards. This is particularly useful for the users with limited technical knowledge and identifying risk scenario using limited effort. Even the decision makers can understand the risk scenario of the country, by their own, using this application.
